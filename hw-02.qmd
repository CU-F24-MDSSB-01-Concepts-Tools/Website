title: "Homework 02"
subtitle: "Data Visualization and Data Wrangling, R and python "
---

The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to **Data Visualization** and **Data Wrangling** in **R** and **python**.


To that end, we provide the repository `hw2-USERNAME` two starter quarto documents

- one for R
- one for python

First, solve the exercises in RStudio with R.   
Once you had the introduction to python you do the same in python. 

The learning goal is to see the differences but, more important, the similarity of how the concepts are implemented. 

**Find the instructions in the README in your repository!**
